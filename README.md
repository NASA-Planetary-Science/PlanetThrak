# PlanetThrak: Planetary Thermal Cracking
Thermal fracturing and serpentinization calculations used in Vance et al (2007; Astrobiology) and Vance et al. (2016; Geophysical Research Letters) and Vance and Melwani Daswani (2020; Phil. Trans. Royal Soc.)

The set of functions and lookup tables for Matlab generates two-layer radial structures for different planets (including spherical moons).
These are used to estimate the extent of microfracturing in different worlds, and the resulting generation of hydrogen through time retrogressive hydroxylation (hydration) of olivine and pyroxene rocks that is also referred to as serpentinization.

The calculations used in the different papers will be executed by running plot_PTCracking_planets.m
Alternative calculations—e.g., with different grain sizes or heat flow values, or adding new objects—should be easy to make by tweaking parameters in this file.
